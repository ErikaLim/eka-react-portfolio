Once on the site, users can select a category from the accordion on the right side of the page.  Once they click on the category name, the accordion opens and in the content of the accordion, the user can see a list of subgroups and a pallet of custom options.  When a user clicks on a option thumbnail, they can see a description of the option as well as a price.  On the left hand side of the app, there is an image of a guitar that gets updated with all of the user selected options.  There are a couple of buttons in between the picture viewer area and the accordion that has an additional view of the guitar body with all of the user selected options.",

I built the backend in rails, and used javascript, html, handlebars,  jQuery, and AJAX for the frontend.  Users can do a search on the app by category or name of restaurant, and search results come from Yelp.  The search results also appear on a map that has markers with restaurant info.  The markers also have the last user reported wait time, and the markers and accordion update instantly without having to refresh the page.  Wait times are stored only for a couple hours in the postgreSQL database.",
